## Let's Make a Dashboard!

<img src=./images/chicks.jpg style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"></img>

## Objective
The built-in ChickWeight dataset contains four variables: weight (g), Time (age in days), Chick (ID), and Diet. Let's create a dashboard with 2 tabs. The dashboard will have a slider for Time, so we can see the chicks' weights at a particular point in time.

The first tab will contain value boxes, an image of our chicks, and a plot of weight vs Chick ID. The second tab will contain a table of the raw data.

## Dashboard Sidebar
The sidebar will have two components: 

1. a slider for Time, that filters data for chosen time point
2. a menu with items for the main dashboard page and the raw data

## Value Boxes

- Box 1: Number of Chicks
- Box 2: Days Since Birth
- Box 3: Average Weight

For Box 3, have the box change color based on the average weight.
- Red: < 75
- Yellow: >= 75 & < 150
- Green: >= 150

## Chick Image and Plot

Add chicks.jpg (located in www folder) to the dashboard.

Create a scatter plot of weight vs Chick, grouped by Diet.

## Bonus

Add some UVA colors!

Use adminlte_color and adminlte_sidebar.
